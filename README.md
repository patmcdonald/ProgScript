Python coding exercises from my Programming and Scripting course.
This is part of my studies for the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with GMIT.

[Exercise 1](https://github.com/patmcdonald/ProgScript/blob/master/fib.py)
##This file is the first python program of the course. It displays a fibonacci output of inputed integers.

[Exercise 2](https://github.com/patmcdonald/ProgScript/blob/master/fibname.py)
##This file is the second python program of the course. It displays a fibonacci output based in my name.

[Exercise 3](https://github.com/patmcdonald/ProgScript/blob/master/collatz.py)
##This file is the third python program of the course. 
##It's a program that outputs the collatz conjecture based on an inputed integer.
##I used code I found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/57r6bf/collatz_conjecture_program/?st=jdhil1j5&sh=ba8fd995) to find a solution.

[Exercise 4](https://github.com/patmcdonald/ProgScript/blob/master/euler5.py)
##This file contains code I have researched to find a solution to [Project Euler,problem 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)
##I've commented out most of the solutions I've researched, but run the most elegant I could find!

[Exercise 5](https://github.com/patmcdonald/ProgScript/blob/master/openfile.py)
##This program imports, opens and displays a formatted output of [Fishers Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

[Exercise 6](https://github.com/patmcdonald/ProgScript/blob/master/factorial.py)
##This program takes an input of an integer and outputs the factorial of that integer.
##I've used the python [math module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) from the python standard library.
##I researched python functions code on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5136447/function-for-factorial-in-python)
and concluded that the most efficient solution was to use what python already has built in!
